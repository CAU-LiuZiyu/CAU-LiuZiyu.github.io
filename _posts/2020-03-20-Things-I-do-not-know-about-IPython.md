# Things I don't know about IPython #

I was using Jupyter Notebook for demenstrating in my class. 

I just used it as a completely ordinary tool.

However, there is much more I don't know about it.

### ? = help() ###

In IPython, use a ? after a variable or a function to get help! Remember, no paranthesis after the function.

### ?? to peek the source code ###

In IPython, use a ? after a function name to peek the source code! Remember, no paranthesis after the function.

###  %run ###

You could always use $run filepath to run a .py file in IPython!

### tab ###

Use 'Tab' on your keyborad to automatically complete your code. Could be used after variable to get the attributes or methods, even after import!

### %magic and %lsmagic ###

Show me the magic! Aha, I mean all the magic function.

### %hist ###

Show your imput history in current IPython.

### %pdb ###
Control the automatic calling of the pdb interactive debugger.

### %reset ###
Resets the namespace by removing all names defined by the user, if
called without arguments, or by removing some types of objects, such
as everything currently in IPython's In[] and Out[] containers (see
the parameters for details).

### %who ###
Print all interactive variables, with some minimal formatting.

### %time ###

Time execution of a Python statement or expression.

### %timeit ###

Run the statement afterwoards for multi-times and estimate the average time it consumes. Usually used in function comparison.
