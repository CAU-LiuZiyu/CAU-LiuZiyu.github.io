## Hello, World!

>This is my first blog post.

I decided to blog yesterday evening. 

The unexamined life is not worth living. Since I'd been seperated with my journal notebook for more than two months, I kinda lost control of my life. 

With the help of [this amazing tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/), I launch this site today.

First of all, I'd like to review a few things I did in last few days.

1. Preparing for lesson 3 of my class [Data Analysis with Python](https://github.com/CAU-LiuZiyu/Data-Analysis-with-Python) .
2. Watching the whole 40 episodes of [Crash Course Computer Science ](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av21376839?from=search&seid=6408323632849980995) .
3. Establishing this blog and making the first post.

Here're the things I plan to do this week.

- [ ] Get my new car, a BYD SONG pro EV.
- [ ] Prepare for lesson 4.
- [ ] Organize notes on Crash Course Computer Science and make a post.
- [ ] Try make a daily tracker on this blog.
- [ ] Translate TDO into Chinese.
- [ ] Check the disstertation of YHH.
- [ ] Draft proposal for CNSF.
