Here're the things I plan to do this week.

- [x] Get my new car, a BYD SONG pro EV.
- [ ] Prepare for lesson 4.
- [x] Organize notes on Crash Course Computer Science and make a post.
- [ ] Try make a daily tracker on this blog.
- [ ] Translate TDO into Chinese.
- [ ] Revise the disstertation of YHH.
- [ ] Draft proposal for CNSF.

It's way too much trouble to update this list everyday. I'd better figure a way to load a dynamic list on the homepage or a list page.
